      Atyrau (together with Aktau) is Kazakhstan's main harbour city on the
      Caspian Sea, Atyrau at the delta of the Ural River. Atyrau city is
      approximately 20 metres (66 feet) below sea level. The city is considered
      to be located both in Asia and Europe, as it is divided by the Ural River.
      The city is a hub for the oil-rich Caspian Depression; because of this,
      many oil wells have been drilled in the Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field
      areas. An oil pipeline runs from Atyrau to Samara, where it joins the
      Russian pipeline system. A separate oil pipeline runs from the Tengiz
      field to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiisk.
